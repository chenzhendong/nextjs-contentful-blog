WASHINGTON—President Biden’s push for a sweeping coronavirus-relief bill is emerging as the first test of his pledge to bring a return of bipartisanship to Washington, a promise made more difficult as partisan lines are hardening in the Senate over the impeachment fate of his predecessor.

On Sunday, Brian Deese, head of the White House’s National Economic Council, is scheduled to confer with a group of lawmakers previously involved in bipartisan negotiations to discuss President Biden’s coronavirus-relief bill.

Mr. Biden earlier this month rolled out a $1.9 trillion plan that would provide an additional $1,400 in direct payments per person, topping off the $600 checks approved in December. The plan also includes money for rental assistance and food stamps, to extend federal unemployment assistance through September and increase the weekly federal subsidy to $400 from $300.

Some Republicans have raised concerns about the proposal’s price tag and the inclusion of unrelated, longtime Democratic policy proposals such as an increase in the minimum wage.
